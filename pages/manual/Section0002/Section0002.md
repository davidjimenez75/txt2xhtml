## Compatible with Markdown *.md files 

![Makdown Logo](./markdown.png "Makdown Logo")

This is just a sample. You can play around with your own text right here.

Markdown
-------------

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
  - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!

#### Code

Code can be inline, `using backticks`. Or it can be in blocks, either with backtick "fences" or with indents of four spaces. (I prefer fences.)

```python
print('You get syntax highlighting...')
print('...if you include the language name')
```

You can also syntax-highlight some other cool stuff, like file diffs:
```diff
- This line got removed
+ This line got added
```
